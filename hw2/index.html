		<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
		<p>
			In this homework/project, I implemented a few algorithms and gained familiarity with common methods use to
			create 3D models and perform operations on them. In the first section, I implemented Bezier curves in 2D and
			3D using De Casteljau's algorithm. In the second section, I used the half-edge data structure in order to
			implement side flips, splits, and upscaling.
		</p>
		<br>


		<h2 align="middle">Section I: Bezier Curves and Surfaces</h2>

		<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier Curves with 1D de Casteljau Subdivision</h3>


		<b>
			Briefly explain de Casteljau's algorithm and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier curves.
		</b>
		<p>
			de Casteljau's algorithm is a recursive function which repeatedly performs linear interpolation between the
			control points until one value is remaining. This is done for all points in the range [0,1]. The resulting
			array of points gives you the final Bezier Curve.
		</p>
		<br>


		<b>
			Take a look at the provided .bzc files and create your own Bezier curve with 6 control points of your
			choosing. Use this Bezier curve for your screenshots below.
		</b>

		<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Bezier Surfaces with Separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
		<b>
			Briefly explain how de Casteljau algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces and how you implemented it in order to
			evaluate Bezier surfaces.
		</b>
		<p>
			In 3D (creating surfaces), de Casteljau's algorithm remains very similar to the 2D plane. Control points are
			evaluated recursively via de Casteljau's along a single axis first. Once all the values are computed for all
			the axis, it forms a series of points along one final plane. De Casteljau's algorithm is run to completion
			on this again until a single point is evaluated. This algorithm is repeated for all pairs of u,v in the
			range [[0,1], [0,1]].

		<h3 align="middle">Part 3: Area-Weighted Vertex Normals</h3>

		<b>
			Briefly explain how you implemented the area-weighted vertex normals.
		</b>
		<p>
			As described in the homework spec, the normal area vector can be calculated by taking the cross product of
			two vectors that lie along the plane of the triangle. Thus our task is two located the three vertices. This
			was done by looping through the halfedges of the vertex and appending saving the position of each vertex
			attached to the half edge.

		<h3 align="middle">Part 4: Edge Flip</h3>
		<b>
			Briefly explain how you implemented the edge flip operation and describe any interesting implementation /
			debugging tricks you have used.
		</b>
		<p>
			Implementing the edge flip was quite tricky, however, meticulously following the hints provided on the
			project spec was very helpful. The process was made much easier by identifying each individual element and
			their new pointers. Perhaps less of a debugging trick, but more of a check, I tried to write code that
			followed some sort of pattern, with some sort of naming convention. This helped a lot in making sure I was
			adding the right pointers. Another debugging trick I used was spamming `printf` statements.

		<b>
			Write about your eventful debugging journey, if you have experienced one.
		</b>
		<p>
			Before going into this, I spent a lot of time reading documentation on how iterators and pointers worked for
			edge of the Iter elements in the codebase. This helped a lot when making the initial jump start into writing
			code for this portion. However, I realized that I had a lot more conceptual holes, particularly which vertex
			is referenced in the halfedge struct. I spent a lot of time through trial-and-error to figure out the
			correct orientation until flips would work correctly.
		</p>
		<br>


		<h3 align="middle">Part 5: Edge Split</h3>
		<b>
			Briefly explain how you implemented the edge split operation and describe any interesting implementation /
			debugging tricks you have used.
		</b>
		<p>
			The process for implementing edge splits was much smoother after having completed the previous part. I
			meticulously gathered all the elements and just filled in the changes for each pointer. Having a diagram on
			paper right next to me using the same variable names as in code was also very helpful.

		<br>


		<b>
			Write about your eventful debugging journey, if you have experienced one.
		</b>
		<p>
			The debugging horros of this task was simply due to the sheer volume of pointers I needed to keep track of.
			I had initially written all the elements in numbers, ranging from half-edge 0 through half-edge 11. I
			realized this would get confusing way too quickly, and thus I resorted to a more succint convention which
			follows compass directions: SW, NW, NE, SE. The rest of the journey was signficantly less confusing
			afterwards.

			handling split operations on boundary edges.

		<h3 align="middle">Part 6: Loop Subdivision for Mesh Upsampling</h3>
		<b>
			Briefly explain how you implemented the loop subdivision and describe any interesting implementation /
			debugging tricks you have used.
		</b>
		<p>
			I separated the implementation for this section into 5 separate loops, as described in the function
			description. This was very helpful in abstracting different sections of the algorithm and made
			implementation a lot easier.

			For the first two parts, I had separate loops for edges and vertices using the
			mesh.xxxBegin iterators and performed some mathematics to get the new position of the vectors. They were
			stored in their respective newPosition fields.

			Next I went through the vertices and edges again to perform splits and flips. For splitting, in order to
			prevent an infinite loop, I used the iterator up to mesh.nEdges() times. I also marked each new vertices as
			new, and I slightly modified the splitEdge function from part 4 to mark the two new edges. Then I looped
			through the edges to flip those attaching old and new vertices. On edge splits, I marked new vector
			positions from the previously saved new edge positions from part 2.

			For the last part, I looped through all the vertices once again. If the newPosition was filled, I would
			overwrite the vector's position.
		</p>
		<br>


		<b>
			Take some notes, as well as some screenshots, of your observations on how meshes behave after loop
			subdivision. What happens to sharp corners and edges? Can you reduce this effect by pre-splitting some
			edges?
		</b>
		<p>
			Due to the new vertex position calculations and vertex repositioning, sharp edges and corners are often
			smoothed out after loop subdivision. In fact almost all shapes via this subdivision approaches a smooth path
			that almost simulates a circle. In order to prevent this effect, implementation would need to be quite
			specific to the edge that is to be preserved. In the square example, it's hard to maintain, even with
			pre-splitting, the algorithm still averages the updated position of the vector. Perhaps one way to do this
			would be to split the corners into a vertex with very high degree, and the surrounding vertices stay very
			close to the center thus to maintain the sharp corner.
		</p>
		<br>


		<b>
			Load dae/cube.dae. Perform several iterations of loop subdivision on the cube. Notice that the cube becomes
			slightly asymmetric after repeated subdivisions. Can you pre-process the cube with edge flips and splits so
			that the cube subdivides symmetrically? Document these effects and explain why they occur. Also explain how
			your pre-processing helps alleviate the effects.
		</b>
		<div align="middle">
			<img src="images/task6_1.png" align="middle" width="50%">
		</div>
		<p>
			At every level, the corners of the cube is averaged more and more into a circle. This is a result of the
			vertex position recalculation, whch has the idea of smoothing out corners in mind.
		</p>
		<div align="middle">
			<img src="images/task6_2.png" align="middle" width="50%">
		</div>
		<p>
			A possible solution to alleviate this is to perform some pre-processing and modifying the smoothing
			calculation. For such corners and edges such as the one seen in the cube, we could mark those edges as
			"corner vertices". We can then add another factor into the calculation that maintains the positions of those
			vectors without smoothing them.
